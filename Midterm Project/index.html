      <h1>About My Trip</h1>
      <p>During my summer vacation, I traveled through the American Southwest, visiting Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Arizona,
        and Utah. Each place had its own atmosphere and beauty — from bright city lights to quiet desert views and
        colorful rocks shaped by time.<br>
        In Las Vegas, I was amazed by how lively the city was, especially at night. The streets were full of neon
        lights, music, and people from all over the world. Every hotel had a different theme, and the energy of the city
        never seemed to stop.<br>
        Los Angeles offered a completely different feeling. I enjoyed the ocean breeze at Santa Monica Beach and watched
        the sunset paint the sky in warm colors. The city was full of art, music, and creativity. I also visited
        Hollywood and saw the Walk of Fame, which made me feel like I was inside a movie.<br>
        When I reached Arizona, I was surrounded by nature’s incredible beauty. The desert felt endless, with red rocks
        glowing under the sun. One of the highlights was visiting Horseshoe Bend, where the Colorado River curves
        gracefully through the deep canyon. Standing at the edge, I felt both calm and amazed by the power of
        nature.<br>
        Then I continued into Utah, where the scenery changed again — tall cliffs, winding roads, and wide open spaces.
        Among the many stunning views, Forrest Gump Point was unforgettable. The long straight road stretched toward the
        distant mountains, just like in the famous movie Forrest Gump. The silence and open space made me feel free,
        like time had slowed down.<br>
        This journey was full of contrasts — the excitement of big cities, the peace of the desert, and the beauty of
        nature’s shapes and colors. Traveling through Nevada, California, Arizona, and Utah showed me how diverse the
        American landscape is. It was a trip full of discovery, adventure, and moments I will never forget.</p>
