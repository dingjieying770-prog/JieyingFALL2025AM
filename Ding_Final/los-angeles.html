            <h2>04 Food</h2>
            <p>In Los Angeles, I tried a variety of delicious foods from different restaurants. From street snacks to
                fine dining, every meal was a new and exciting experience. I sampled savory street tacos bursting
                with flavor, sweet and creamy desserts from local bakeries, and indulgent dishes at high-end
                restaurants on the Strip. Each place offered something unique, from exotic international cuisines to
                modern takes on classic American favorites. The vibrant food scene in Las Vegas not only satisfied
                my hunger but also introduced me to creative culinary combinations and flavors I had never tried
                before, making every meal a memorable adventure.
