            <p>Hoover Dam is a massive concrete arch-gravity dam located on the Colorado River, on the border between
                Arizona and Nevada. It was completed in 1936 during the Great Depression and was considered one of the
                greatest engineering achievements of its time. The dam was built to provide flood control, water
                storage, and hydroelectric power for the growing Southwest region. Its reservoir, Lake Mead, is one of
                the largest man-made lakes in the United States and a popular spot for boating and recreation. Hoover
                Dam generates electricity for millions of people in Nevada, Arizona, and California. Visitors can
