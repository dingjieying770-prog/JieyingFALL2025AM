        <h2>ABOUT</h2>

        <p>GENUS:Hypholoma<br>
           SPECIES:asciculare<br>
           TYPE:Gilled Mushroom<br>
           COMMON NAMES:Sulfur Tuft</p>

        <h4>Distribution and habitat</h4>
        <p>Hypholoma fasciculare grows prolifically on the dead wood of both deciduous and coniferous trees. It is more commonly found on decaying deciduous wood due to the lower lignin content of this wood relative to coniferous wood. Hypholoma fasciculare is widespread and abundant in northern Europe and North America. It has been recorded from Iran, and also eastern Anatolia in Turkey. It can appear anytime from spring to autumn.</p>

        <h4>Use in forestry</h4>
        <p>Hypholoma fasciculare has been used successfully as an experimental treatment to competitively displace a common fungal disease of conifers, Armillaria root rot, from managed coniferous forests</p>

       
        <h4>Toxicity</h4>
           <p>The toxicity of sulfur tuft mushrooms has been attributed, at least partially, to the toxic steroids fasciculol E and fasciculol F (in mice, with LD50(i.p.) values of 50 mg/kg and 168 mg/kg, respectively). These fasciculols have been shown to be calmodulin inhibitors. In humans, symptoms may be delayed for 5–10 hours after consumption, after which time there may be diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, proteinuria and collapse. Paralysis and impaired vision have been recorded. Symptoms generally resolve over a few days. The autopsy of one fatality revealed fulminant hepatitis reminiscent of amatoxin poisoning, along with involvement of kidneys and myocardium. The mushroom was consumed in a dish with other species so the death cannot be attributed to sulfur tuft with certainty.</p>

        <h4>Similar species</h4>
        <p>The edible Hypholoma capnoides is similar, but lacks the greenish-yellow gills and bitter taste.[3] H. sublateritium is similar as well, with a reddish cap.[5] Members of Pyrrhulomyces may also appear similar.</p>

        <h4>Microscopic characteristics</h4>
        <p>The spores are purple-black in colour. The spores are 6–8 × 4–4.5 μm in size and are shaped like an egg.</p>
